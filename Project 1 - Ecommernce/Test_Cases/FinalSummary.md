# Final Test Summary
**KrishnaMart Grocery E-Commerce Website**  
**Test Plan Identifier:** TP_KrishnaMart_v1.0_2025-06-08  
**Overall Status:** ❌ **Not ready for production** (23 % failure rate; critical security & e-commerce issues)

---

## 1. Critical Issues Blocking Release

| Module            | Failure Rate | Key Problems |
|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Registration**  | 48 %         | Duplicate usernames allowed; blank passwords accepted; no required-field validation |
| **Add to Cart**   | 39 %         | No inventory validation → overselling risk; out-of-stock items can be added |
| **Payment**       | 41 %         | Expired/invalid cards accepted; CVV & cardholder name not enforced; sensitive data exposed via back button |
| **Login**         | 18 %         | No account lockout; session timeout not enforced |

---

## 2. High-Priority Issues (Fix Before Release)
- **Contact form:** missing validation for name & message fields; file-upload size/type limits not enforced
- **Homepage:** broken images/links; social-media links open in same window
- **User Profile:** email format validation fails; password-strength requirements absent

---

## 3. Modules Ready or Near-Ready

| Module           | Pass Rate | Notes |
|------------------|-----------|-------|
| **Product Page** | 91 %      | Only stock-status warnings & “recently viewed” tracking broken |
| **User Profile** | 92 %      | Minor validation fixes needed |
| **Homepage**     | 83 %      | Minor fixes (broken links, popup timing) |

---

## 4. Immediate Recommendations
1. **Block production release** until all critical payment, registration, and inventory issues are resolved.
2. **Prioritize fixes** in this order:  
   a. Payment validation (expired/invalid cards, CVV, cardholder name)  
   b. Registration input validation (duplicate users, blank passwords, required fields)  
   c. Add-to-cart inventory management (prevent overselling)  
   d. Login security (account lockout, session timeout)
3. **Retest** all high-severity fixes before re-launch.
4. **Enhance QA coverage** for future releases to avoid recurrence of critical defects.

---

## 5. Final Verdict
KrishnaMart is **not production-ready** due to fundamental security and e-commerce integrity failures. Address the critical issues above, retest thoroughly, and obtain sign-off from the Test Lead and Project Manager before release.
